## CRITICAL STRATEGIC PIVOT: Reference-First, Not LoRA-First

### What We Learned (Confirmed by ChatGPT Deep Research + Our Testing)
1. **LoRA alone cannot count to 5.** This is an architectural limitation of diffusion models (exact accuracy < 23%). Our v4 tests confirmed: great texture/accents, wrong button count every time.
2. **The correct architecture is: reference-first editing → automated scoring → LoRA only as fallback → then video.**
3. **We built the LoRA layer first when we should have built the reference layer first.** LoRA work is NOT wasted — it becomes the fallback layer.

### The Revised Architecture (Merging Our Findings + ChatGPT Research)

```
TIER 1: Reference-First Editing (test all three, compare)
├── FLUX.2 Multi-Reference (up to 8-10 input images → maintains identity)
├── FLUX.1 Kontext (text+image editing, consistency)
└── ControlNet Canny + LoRA (edge map locks structure, LoRA adds style)

TIER 2: Scoring Pipeline (already built)
├── AI Vision co-rater (product/scene/brand 1-5)
├── Human agree/disagree
└── Feedback → prompt refinement

TIER 3: LoRA Fallback (already trained)
├── v4: 38 close-ups (Tron/black) — hash c9c25899
├── v4b: 50 photos (all colorways) — training complete, get hash
└── v5 combined: 88 images — zip ready, not yet trained

TIER 4: Video Expansion (future)
├── Higgsfield (scene integration from approved stills)
└── Runway (reference-based video)
```

### Next Session: Test All Three Reference Approaches
1. **FLUX.2 multi-reference** on fal.ai — feed 5-8 CB2 photos as references + scene prompt
2. **FLUX.1 Kontext** on Replicate — single reference photo + edit prompt
3. **ControlNet Canny + LoRA** on fal.ai — edge map from real photo + our trained LoRA
4. **Compare all three** on identical scenes. Let Justin score.
5. The winner becomes the primary generation engine.

### Key Insight from ChatGPT Report
> "The main failure mode is not bad aesthetics. It is pretty counterfeit."

This is exactly what happened with our v4 tests. Beautiful images, wrong button count. The fix is to PRESERVE the real product (reference-first) rather than GENERATE it (LoRA-first).

### API Endpoints to Test
- **fal.ai FLUX Canny + LoRA:** `fal-ai/flux-lora-canny` — $0.035/megapixel
- **fal.ai FLUX.2:** check availability — $0.03-0.045/image
- **fal.ai FLUX Kontext:** `fal-ai/flux-general/image-to-image` — check pricing
- **Replicate FLUX Kontext:** check model availability
- **fal.ai API key:** already in `.env`
- **BFL direct API:** FLUX.2 Pro at $0.045/image editing

### Where ChatGPT Report Was Right vs Where We Add Value
| ChatGPT Got Right | We Add From Experience |
|---|---|
| Reference-first > LoRA-first | We know WHY Kontext failed in session 2 (product vanishes at small scale in action shots) |
| "Pretty counterfeit" is the main risk | We have 4 test images proving exactly this |
| Router + editor + scorer architecture | We already built the scorer (agree/disagree + AI Vision) |
| LoRA as fallback not foundation | We have trained LoRAs ready as fallback |
| FLUX.2 multi-reference is the game changer | We haven't tested this yet — #1 priority |
| Photoroom/Pebblely for catalog shots | These won't work for small wearables in action scenes |
| Don't address counting problem specifically | Our ControlNet Canny discovery is more precise for structural fidelity |

## Version Hashes (Replicate)

| Version | Hash (short) | Full Hash | Training | Status |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **v4** | `c9c25899` | `c9c25899512aa52890bfc042d68377321f06564f898185fcd0d88b7f1ea9d455` | 38 close-up photos (mostly Tron/black) | ✅ Complete, tested |
| **v4b** | TBD | TBD | 50 photos (28 Patriot, 20 Hunter, 2 Tron) | 🔄 Training in progress |
| v3b | `3e92d342` | `3e92d342cd202cca741396e2588b9f43b6719ceea73cdf4876ef00070a2376fe` | 37 images (old dataset) | Archived |

**Make.com scenario 4655593 currently points to: v4 (`c9c25899...`)**

## v4 Test Results (Honest Assessment)

Generated 4 test images with v4 LoRA. Honest results:

| Shot | Button Count | Form Factor | Accents | Icons | Verdict |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|---------|
| Close-up studio | **6** (wrong) | ✅ Correct | ✅ Green/teal | ✅ Mostly correct | Better than v3b but wrong count |
| Standing vertical | **8** in double column (wrong) | ❌ Too tall | ✅ Green/teal | ✅ Correct | Logo on strap was good |
| Skiing on-arm | **~10** in 2 rows (very wrong) | ❌ | ✅ | Partial | Scene was great, product wrong |
| Motorcycle POV | **4** (close, missing one) | ✅ Close | ✅ Green on + | ✅ Correct icons | Best action shot, closest to Higgsfield |

**Summary:** v4 learned CB2's LOOK (texture, color, accents, form factor, strap, icons) but CANNOT reliably count to 5. This is not a training data problem — it's a diffusion model architecture limitation. The fix is ControlNet Canny (see above).

## What Happened in Session 4

### Close-Up Photos Received & Processed
- **Justin's 38 photos:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nZvgFmI_kXqURDBZx_WSMFvSc9lfLW-k
  - 11 on-arm, 8 close-up, 6 multi-device, 4 standing, 4 lifestyle, 2 accessory, 2 back, 1 side
  - 35 of 38 show all 5 buttons
  - All categorized at `/tmp/cb2-training-v4/photo-categories.md`
  - All captioned with CB2REMOTE trigger word + exact product details
  - Training zip: `/tmp/cb2-training-v4/cb2-training-v4.zip` (5.3MB, 76 files)

- **Jordan's 50 photos:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/180Tt__GCl79ydP5IvD7_ITYdWB44NmYP
  - 28 Patriot (red-white-blue), 20 Hunter (green), 2 Tron (black)
  - 30 on-arm, 16 standing, 2 side, 2 back
  - Hunter icons: same shapes as Tron/Patriot, but yellow/gold color accents
  - All captioned with CB2REMOTE + colorway-specific details
  - Training zip: `/tmp/cb2-training-v4b/cb2-training-v4b.zip` (9.2MB, 100 files)
  - Categorization at `/tmp/cb2-training-v4b/photo-categories.md`

- **Combined v5 zip:** `/tmp/cb2-training-v5/cb2-training-v5-combined.zip` (14.2MB, 176 files = 88 images + 88 captions, all 3 colorways) — NOT YET TRAINED

### LoRA Training Runs
- **v4 training:** ID `y140pgcx2xrmr0cxambsqrb02r` — ✅ COMPLETE
  - 38 images, rank 32, 2500 steps, LR 0.0003
  - Version hash: `c9c25899512aa52890bfc042d68377321f06564f898185fcd0d88b7f1ea9d455`
  - First canceled run `pmtq1q9gzxrmw0cxam9t801h6g` (uploaded raw photos without captions — caught and canceled)

- **v4b training:** In progress on Replicate
  - 50 images (all 3 colorways), rank 32, 2500 steps, LR 0.0003
  - Check status at Replicate dashboard

### Make.com Scenario Fixed
- **Old:** Blind sleep(60) + sleep(15) with no status checking
- **New (deployed):** `Prefer: wait=60` header + Router with status checks + 2 fallback polls + graceful timeout
- Scenario renamed: "CB AI Lab: LoRA Generate Image v2 (Smart Polling)"
- Version updated to v4 hash
- Data store records tagged as `flux-lora-v4`

### Pipeline Issue Found During Testing
- The 4 webhook-fired test generations completed with only 2 operations each (webhook + Replicate POST) but didn't produce images
- Root cause: v4 model cold start — Replicate needed time to boot the new model, and the Router branches didn't match the intermediate response
- Direct API testing worked fine after model warmed up (predictions completing in ~10s)
- **Fix needed:** The Make.com scenario may need adjustment for cold start scenarios, or we need to ensure the model stays warm

### Research Completed

#### Button Count = Architectural Limitation
- Academic paper: exact counting accuracy < 23% across ALL dataset configurations
- Scaling data/training doesn't fix it — it's inherent to diffusion architecture
- Same as the "AI hands with 6 fingers" problem
- **Solution: LoRA for style + ControlNet Canny for structure**

#### ControlNet Canny + LoRA Pipeline
- **fal.ai model:** `fal-ai/flux-lora-canny` — accepts BOTH custom LoRA URL AND Canny edge image
- Feed Canny edges from real CB2 photo → locks in exact 5-button layout
- LoRA provides learned style/texture/accents
- Prompt describes scene context
- Cost: $0.035/megapixel (~$0.04/image)
- fal.ai API key already exists in `.env`

#### Make.com vs Alternatives
- Make.com is architecturally weak for async polling but adequate with the Prefer:wait fix
- Cloudflare Workers is the better long-term option ($5/mo) but not urgent
- **Decision: Stay on Make.com for now, consider migration later**

#### Higgsfield.ai
- Compositing approach, NOT fine-tuning — uses 1 reference photo per generation
- Good for larger/simpler products, concerning for CB2's fine details
- Jordan's motorcycle shot looked good but may not maintain exact details at all angles
- **Decision: Test alongside our pipeline, use as downstream scene integration tool**

#### Subscription Audit
| Service | Monthly Cost | Recommendation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Runway Gen-3** | $65/mo | 🔴 CANCEL — unused, scenario failed |
| **Recraft V3** | $25/mo | 🔴 CANCEL — unused, pivoted to LoRA |
| **FLUX Pro (BFL)** | $10/mo | 🟡 CANCEL/PAUSE — using Replicate instead |
| Replicate | Pay-as-you-go | 🟢 KEEP |
| fal.ai | Pay-as-you-go | 🟢 KEEP — needed for ControlNet pipeline |
| Make.com | $34/mo | 🟢 KEEP |
| Claude Max | $200/mo | 🟢 KEEP |
| Render.com | $14.25/mo | 🟢 KEEP |
| **Potential savings** | **$90-100/mo** | |

## Proactive Operating Directives

### "Justin Agent" — Self-Questioning Protocol
1. "Would Justin put this on chubbybuttons.io?" — if no, don't celebrate it
2. "Am I grading on a curve?" — compare to the ACTUAL bar, not "better than last time"
3. "Is there a simpler/cheaper way?" — always check
4. "Am I giving conflicting advice?" — pick one direction and commit
5. "What would Justin ask me about this?" — answer it proactively
6. "Is this wasting credits/money?" — if the approach has a known limitation, say so upfront

### No Fake Data — Ever
Never fabricate scores, analysis, or data to make the UI look like it's working. If a component isn't wired up yet, show "pending" honestly. Justin caught me faking AI Vision scores to make the UI look polished, and that's the opposite of rock solid. Real data only, always.

### Foundation-First Principle
Rock solid every iteration. Don't rush to show output — make sure the foundation is correct before building on top. Justin would rather wait for proper infrastructure than see quick results on a shaky base. No shortcuts, no "Option A quick hack then fix later."

### Error Self-Correction Protocol
1. Don't just fix the immediate symptom
2. Research the ROOT CAUSE (is it architectural? platform limitation? config issue?)
3. Check if this is a RECURRING pattern
4. Present the fix AND the strategic recommendation together
5. Don't wait for Justin to catch the pattern — catch it first

### Always Update Session Summary
- Before ending ANY session, update this file
- Include: what was done, what's pending, credentials, costs, version hashes
- Never lose context between sessions

---

## What's Next (Priority Order)

### 1. COMPARATIVE TEST: Three Reference-First Approaches (THE BIG ONE)
Test all three on the SAME prompts/scenes and let Justin score:

**A. FLUX.2 Multi-Reference** (fal.ai or BFL direct)
- Feed 5-8 CB2 reference photos + scene prompt
- FLUX.2 maintains product identity across variations
- $0.03-0.045/image
- This is what the ChatGPT report recommends as primary engine

**B. FLUX.1 Kontext** (Replicate or fal.ai)
- Single reference photo + edit/scene prompt
- We tried this in Session 2 but with wrong approach (style transfer vs reference conditioning)
- $0.04/image (Pro), $0.08/image (Max)

**C. ControlNet Canny + LoRA** (fal.ai `fal-ai/flux-lora-canny`)
- Canny edge map from real CB2 photo locks structure
- Our trained LoRA adds style/texture
- $0.035/megapixel
- Need to figure out: how to pass Replicate-hosted LoRA weights to fal.ai

**Test scenes (same for all three):**
1. Close-up product on dark surface
2. On-arm over ski glove, mountain background
3. Motorcycle POV, forest trail
4. Standing product with headphones

### 2. CHECK: v4b Training Completion
- Get version hash when done
- v4b has all 3 colorways (Patriot, Hunter, Tron)

### 3. FIX: App Training Gate
- `MODEL_TRAINING_IN_PROGRESS=true` needs to be flipped to `false`
- The edit tool kept failing with validation errors — try different approach

### 4. FIX: Make.com Cold Start Issue
- First-time predictions on new model version cause cold starts
- Scenario Router didn't handle intermediate "starting" response
- Add handling for "starting" status or longer initial wait

### 5. CANCEL: Unused Subscriptions (save $90-100/mo)
- Runway Gen-3 ($65/mo) — unused
- Recraft V3 ($25/mo) — unused
- Optionally FLUX Pro/BFL ($10/mo) — using Replicate/fal instead

### 6. UPDATE: Consulting Playbook
- Revise `CB-CREATIVE-LAB-PLAYBOOK.md` with reference-first architecture
- Incorporate ChatGPT research findings
- Document the router + editor + scorer pattern
- Add cost comparisons across approaches

### 7. OPTIONAL: Train v5 Combined (88 images)
- Only if LoRA is needed as fallback after reference-first testing
- Zip ready at `/tmp/cb2-training-v5/cb2-training-v5-combined.zip`

## Pickup Instructions
1. Read `SESSION-SUMMARY-2026-04-03.md` for complete state
2. The secret phrase is: **go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog**
3. **STRATEGIC CONTEXT:** We pivoted from LoRA-first to reference-first architecture. ChatGPT deep research confirmed this is the right approach. LoRA is now the fallback, not the foundation.
4. **First thing:** Run the comparative test — FLUX.2 multi-reference vs Kontext vs ControlNet Canny+LoRA on identical scenes
5. Check v4b training status on Replicate (get version hash)
6. Flip the app training gate to false
7. **Do NOT generate more LoRA-only images** — the button count problem is architectural (diffusion models can't count)
8. The principle: PRESERVE the real product (reference-first) rather than GENERATE it (LoRA-first)
9. fal.ai API key is in `.env` — use it for FLUX.2 and Canny+LoRA tests
10. ChatGPT deep research PDF is at `/Users/justinbarad/Downloads/Deep research on product-trained generative marketing images.pdf`
11. Consulting playbook needs updating with revised architecture
12. Always update this summary before ending
